# 🔐 Authentication Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you set up proper authentication for your Tony Properties admin panel using Supabase Auth. This replaces the simple hardcoded login with a secure, scalable authentication system.

## 🚀 **What We've Implemented**

1. **Supabase Authentication Context** - Manages user state across the admin panel
2. **Secure Login Page** - Modern, responsive login with email/password
3. **Protected Routes** - Admin routes are now protected by authentication
4. **Session Management** - Automatic session handling and persistence
5. **Logout Functionality** - Secure logout with confirmation

## 📋 **Prerequisites**

- ✅ Supabase project already set up
- ✅ Database schema already migrated
- ✅ Environment variables configured

## 🔧 **Setup Steps**

### **Step 1: Create Your First Admin Account**

1. **Go to your admin panel**: `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
2. **Click "Don't have an account? Sign up"**
3. **Enter your email and password** (minimum 6 characters)
4. **Click "Create Account"**
5. **Check your email** for the confirmation link
6. **Click the confirmation link** in your email
7. **Return to the login page** and sign in with your credentials

### **Step 2: Test Authentication**

1. **Sign in** with your new account
2. **Verify you can access** all admin pages
3. **Test property deletion** - it should now work correctly
4. **Check the user info** in the header (should show your email)

### **Step 3: Re-enable Row Level Security (Optional but Recommended)**

After confirming authentication works:

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Open SQL Editor**
3. **Run the script**: `scripts/re-enable-rls.sql`
4. **Verify RLS is enabled** for all tables

## 🔒 **Security Features**

### **What's Protected**
- ✅ All admin routes require authentication
- ✅ User sessions are managed securely
- ✅ Logout clears all session data
- ✅ Password requirements enforced
- ✅ Email confirmation required

### **Authentication Flow**
1. **User visits admin page** → Redirected to login if not authenticated
2. **User logs in** → Credentials verified with Supabase
3. **Session created** → User can access admin panel
4. **User logs out** → Session destroyed, redirected to login

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **"Email not confirmed" error**
- Check your email for the confirmation link
- Spam folder might contain the email
- Click the confirmation link before trying to sign in

#### **"Invalid credentials" error**
- Ensure you're using the correct email/password
- Check that your account was confirmed via email
- Try the "Forgot Password" feature if available

#### **"Authentication failed" error**
- Check your Supabase environment variables
- Ensure your Supabase project is active
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages

#### **Properties still not deleting after authentication**
- RLS might still be disabled
- Run the RLS re-enable script
- Check that you're properly signed in

### **Debug Steps**

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are correct
3. **Check Supabase Dashboard** for authentication logs
4. **Ensure you're signed in** by checking the header

## 🔄 **Managing Users**

### **Adding More Admin Users**
1. **Share the signup URL**: `/admin/login`
2. **New users sign up** with their email/password
3. **They confirm their email**
4. **They can sign in** and access the admin panel

### **User Management (Future Enhancement)**
- User roles and permissions
- Admin user management
- Password reset functionality
- Two-factor authentication

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate**
1. ✅ Test the authentication system
2. ✅ Verify property deletion works
3. ✅ Re-enable RLS for security

### **Future Enhancements**
1. **User Management Dashboard**
2. **Role-based Access Control**
3. **Activity Logging**
4. **Password Reset**
5. **Two-Factor Authentication**

## 📱 **Testing the System**

### **Test Scenarios**

1. **Unauthenticated Access**
   - Visit `/admin` without logging in
   - Should redirect to `/admin/login`

2. **Successful Login**
   - Sign in with valid credentials
   - Should access admin dashboard
   - Header should show your email

3. **Property Operations**
   - Add a new property
   - Edit an existing property
   - Delete a property
   - All operations should work correctly

4. **Logout**
   - Click logout button
   - Should redirect to login page
   - Can't access admin pages without re-authentication

## 🔐 **Security Best Practices**

1. **Use strong passwords** (minimum 8 characters recommended)
2. **Don't share credentials** with unauthorized users
3. **Log out** when using shared computers
4. **Keep your email secure** (used for password reset)
5. **Regularly review** admin user access
